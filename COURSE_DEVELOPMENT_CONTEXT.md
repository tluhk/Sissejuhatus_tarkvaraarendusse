# Course Development Session Context

## 📚 Course Overview
**Course Name**: Sissejuhatus tarkvaraarendusse (Introduction to Software Development)  
**Target**: Complete beginners with no software development knowledge  
**Format**: 6 seminars + exam, 6 EAP  
**Philosophy**: Complete software development lifecycle WITHOUT coding  

## 🎯 Course Structure Finalized

### Core Concept
Students work on a **real problem-solving project** throughout the course, experiencing the full development process through documentation, planning, and collaboration.

### Seminar Breakdown
1. ✅ **Seminar 1**: Tools introduction (Git, GitHub, Markdown) - COMPLETED
2. ✅ **Seminar 2**: Problem research and analysis - COMPLETED  
3. ✅ **Seminar 3**: Sprint 1 - Planning - MATERIALS CREATED
4. 📝 **Seminar 4**: Sprint 2 - Design - NEEDS MATERIALS
5. 📝 **Seminar 5**: Sprint 3 - Development - NEEDS MATERIALS  
6. 📝 **Seminar 6**: Final presentations and assessment - NEEDS MATERIALS

### Sprint Structure (KEY DECISION)
- **3 actual sprints**: Seminars 3, 4, 5
- **Seminar 6**: Final presentation and assessment (NOT a sprint)
- Each sprint focuses on specific development phase

## 👥 Student Roles (Final Version)

Students work in teams and each takes one specialized role:

1. **Product Owner**: User needs, business logic, priorities
2. **Project Manager**: Project coordination, schedules, processes  
3. **Developer**: Technical solutions and development planning
4. **UX/UI Designer**: User experience, visual design, testing

**Important**: These are simplified learning roles, not full professional positions.

## 📋 Documentation Structure

All student work is in **Markdown files** with specific naming conventions:

### Seminar 2 (Established pattern):
- `problem-definition.md`
- `user-research.md` 
- `requirements.md`
- `competitive-analysis.md`

### Seminar 3 (Sprint 1):
- `project-charter.md`
- `team-roles.md`
- `project-timeline.md`
- `risk-analysis.md`
- `communication-plan.md`
- `sprint-1-plan.md`
- `sprint-1-review.md`
- Role-specific files (e.g., `product-backlog.md`, `technical-architecture.md`)

### Pattern continues for Seminars 4-6 with sprint-specific documentation.

## 🛠 Tools and Technology Stack

**Required Tools**:
- Git (GUI via VSCode or GitHub Desktop)
- GitHub (repositories, issues, projects, pages)
- VSCode (Markdown extensions, Git integration)
- Markdown for all documentation

**Recommended**:
- Paper and pencil (prototyping)
- Phone/camera (documenting prototypes)
- Miro/Figma (digital collaboration)

**Key Point**: NO CODING required - focus on process, planning, collaboration.

## 📖 Material Creation Standards

### Seminar Materials Structure
Each seminar needs:
1. **slides.md** - Marp presentation format
2. **teacher-guide.md** - Comprehensive teaching instructions

### Slides Format Requirements
- Marp format with proper frontmatter
- 90min theory + 90min practice structure
- Clear concept explanations with examples
- Practical workshop instructions

### Teacher Guide Requirements  
- Detailed speech scripts for concepts
- Step-by-step workshop guidance

## 🔑 Key Design Decisions Made

1. **Sprint Structure**: 3 sprints (Sem 3-5) + final presentation (Sem 6)
2. **Roles**: 4 simplified roles instead of complex professional titles  
3. **No Scrum Master**: Replaced with Project Manager for simplicity
4. **Documentation Focus**: All work in Markdown, no actual coding
5. **Real Projects**: Students solve actual problems from their lives
6. **GitHub Workflow**: Professional collaboration tools and processes

## 🎨 Course Philosophy

**Core Message**: 
> "Software is not just code - it's a process for solving people's problems, where code is only one part of the bigger picture."

**Learning Approach**:
- Hands-on, practical learning over theory
- Real project work with tangible outcomes  
- Professional tools and workflows
- Team collaboration and communication skills
- Complete development lifecycle experience
